# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?

I have watched maybe 20% of the lecture videos so far.

## What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?

I usually watch lecture videos at night.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I have always maintained the habit of not using AI tools to help me answer questions or
modify questions. I believe that code should be learned and used independently by myself.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I should read the practical requirement clearly. This time I didn't read it clear and get difficulties in 
committing and using Github. This make my work in a mess and I will improve that next time.

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?

I think the two most important things are to put in more effort and be more dedicated.
I will try my best to actively participate in the courses related to code learning.

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?

Definitely not. I did it so bad because I can't figure the committing work. I did it over and over again 
and made it full of useless messages. I feel annoyed with myself for that. I promise I will make it better
next time.
